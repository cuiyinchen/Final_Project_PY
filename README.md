# Python Project
Customer Personality Analysis using Unsupervised Machine Learning 
## Introduction to the project: 
* The purpose of this python project is to analyze customer personalities in the data
set provided by Kaggle. It is a detailed analysis of the company's ideal customers. The results of
the analysis can help companies better understand their customers, and allow companies to modify
their products according to the specific needs, concerns and behaviours of different types of
customers. 
* By exploring different types of customer segments and explaining why they are a segment
using the methods of unsupervised learning (K-Means, Agglomerative, K-Medoids), we will
identify the key characteristics of their clusters.
